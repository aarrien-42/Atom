# [Anthony] - Intuitive and Simple Programming

The goal of this project is to develop my own programming language. It is a very ambitious and costly project, so initially, it will start as a simple compiler and will grow from there. I don't intend for it to be a complex and deep language, its purpose is rather educational.

## Key Features
- Still working on them

## File Structure
 - Project Directory
    - inc/             # Header files (.hpp)
    - src/             # Source files (.cpp)
    - obj/             # Object files (.o)
    - asm/             # Assembly code files (.s)
    - bin/             # Binaries (executable for getting assembly code and the final executable)
    - lang/            # Own language files (.athy)

## How to use
- Step 1: make *(Compiles files)
- Step 2: ./bin/athy lang/<file>.athy *(Writes a valid assembly code)

## How to Contribute
At this stage, the development is purely personal.
