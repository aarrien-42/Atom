# [Anthony] - Intuitive and Simple Programming

The goal of this project is to develop my own programming language. It is a very ambitious and costly project, so initially, it will start as a simple compiler and will grow from there. I don't intend for it to be a complex and deep language, its purpose is rather educational.

## Key Features:
- Still working on them

## How to use:
...

## How to Contribute:
At this stage, the development is purely personal.
